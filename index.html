<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    This declaration tells the browser that this document is an HTML5 document.
    It's crucial for ensuring the browser renders the page in standards mode.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    <html lang="en">
    This is the root element of an HTML page.
    The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the language of the document content, which helps
    search engines, screen readers, and other applications. 'en' stands for English.
    You can change this if your content is in a different language (e.g., 'fr' for French).
-->
<head>
    <!--
        <head>
        The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title,
        character set, styles, scripts, and other meta settings. This information is NOT
        displayed directly on the web page itself but is used by browsers, search engines,
        and other web services.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        This <meta> tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
        UTF-8 is the recommended character encoding as it supports almost all characters
        and symbols in the world, preventing display issues with various languages.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        This <meta> tag is essential for making your website responsive across different devices
        (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
        - 'width=device-width': Sets the width of the viewport to the device's screen width.
        - 'initial-scale=1.0': Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
        This ensures that the page scales correctly on small screens.
    -->
    <title>Your Website Title Here | A Brief Description</title>
    <!--
        <title>Your Website Title Here | A Brief Description</title>
        The <title> element defines the title of the document, which is displayed in the
        browser's title bar or tab. It's important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
        and user experience, telling visitors what the page is about at a glance.
        **Remember to change this!** Include your website name and perhaps a short,
        relevant phrase.

    <!-- Link to our external CSS file (we'll create this next!) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <!--
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
        - 'rel="stylesheet"': Specifies the relationship of the linked document to the current document.
                               'stylesheet' indicates that the linked file is a Cascading Style Sheet.
        - 'href="style.css"': Specifies the path to the external file. In this case, 'style.css'
                                means the CSS file is located in the same directory as this HTML file.
                                This is how we apply styles to our HTML content.
    -->

    <!-- You can add other things here like favicons, other meta tags, etc. -->

</head>
<body>
    <!--
        <body>
        The <body> element contains all the visible content of the HTML document,
        such as text, images, videos, links, forms, etc. Everything you see on the web page
        is within the body.
    -->

    <header>
        <!--
            <header>
            The <header> element represents introductory content, typically containing
            a group of introductory or navigational aids. It often includes the site logo,
            site title, and the main navigation menu. There can be multiple <header>
            elements on a page, but usually one main one at the top of the <body>.
        -->
        <h1>Welcome to Your Website!</h1>
        <!--
            <h1>
            <h1> to <h6> are heading elements. <h1> is the highest level (most important)
            heading, and <h6> is the lowest. There should generally be only one <h1>
            per page, representing the main title or topic of the page.
            **Change "Welcome to Your Website!"** to your actual site title or main message.
        -->

        <nav>
            <!--
                <nav>
                The <nav> element represents a section of a page that contains navigation links
                â€” links that take the user to other pages on the site or to different sections
                within the same page.
            -->
            <ul>
                <!--
                    <ul>
                    The <ul> element represents an unordered list. List items are typically
                    displayed with bullet points.
                -->
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <!--
                    <li>
                    The <li> element represents a list item within an ordered (<ol>) or
                    unordered (<ul>) list.
                -->
                <!--
                    <a>
                    The <a> element (anchor) creates a hyperlink, which is used to link from
                    one page to another, or within the same page.
                    - 'href="index.html"': The 'href' attribute specifies the URL of the page
                                             the link goes to. 'index.html' refers to this
                                             same file, making it a link back to the homepage.
                -->

                    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
                    To add these links, remove the <!-- ... --> comments and create the
                    corresponding HTML files (e.g., about.html, services.html, contact.html).

    </header>

    <main>
        <!--
            <main>
            The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document.
            The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands
            upon the central topic of the document, or the central functionality of a web
            application. There should only be one <main> element per document.
        -->

        <section class="hero">
            <!--
                <section>
                The <section> element represents a standalone section of a page that doesn't
                have a more specific semantic element to represent it (like <nav> or <article>).
                Sections should typically include a heading.
                - 'class="hero"': This is a CSS class. It's a way to group elements so that
                                   we can apply specific styles to them using CSS. 'hero'
                                   is a common class name for a prominent, often large, section
                                   at the top of a page (like a banner or main call-to-action).

            <!--
                <h2>
                A secondary heading, typically used for major sections within the main content.
                **Change "Your Catchy Headline"** to a compelling hook for your site visitors.
            -->
            <p>A brief description of your website or what you offer. This paragraph should explain
               what your site is about or what value you provide to visitors.</p>
            <!--
                <p>
                The <p> element represents a paragraph of text.
            -->
            <!-- Maybe a call-to-action button -->
            <!--
            <button>Learn More</button>
            The <button> element represents a clickable button. This one is commented out
            but is a common element in hero sections to encourage user interaction.
            You could wrap this in an <a> tag to make it a link that looks like a button.

            <!--
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Description of image">
            The <img> element embeds an image.
            - 'src="..."': Specifies the path to the image file.
            - 'alt="..."': Provides alternative text for the image, which is crucial for
                           accessibility (screen readers) and displayed if the image doesn't load.

            The <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content

            - Copyright information
            - Links to related documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)
            - Author/owner information

            <span id="current-year"></span> : The <span> element is an inline container
                used to group content for styling purposes. The 'id="current-year"' gives it
                a unique identifier so we can easily select it with JavaScript.

        The <script> element is used to embed or link executable code (JavaScript).
        Placing scripts at the end of the <body> is a common practice because it ensures
        that the HTML structure is fully loaded by the browser before the script tries
        to access or modify elements on the page.
        This line is commented out, but you would uncomment it if you create a 'script.js' file.
